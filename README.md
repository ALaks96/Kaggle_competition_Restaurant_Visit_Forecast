# Kaggle_competition_Restaurant_Visit_Forecast

For the final evaluation of my R course at Polytechnique, I was tasked to undergo a project that involved data and R.

With my group, we chose to go through a Kaggle competition which involved forecasting the number of visitors in restaurant in Japan. The idea comes from a Kaggle competition, as were the data which were used in this project.  
To build our forecasting we first wen through a feature engineering process, then used a combination of XGBoost and time series methods for predictions.

Finally, we were deliver our results embedded in a shinyapp with appropriate visualizations, conataine in an R package we had to create which allowed any user in posession of our package access the results with a one liner.
